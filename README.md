## 📊 Overview

This project is designed to help you work with **categorical data** in R. It covers important aspects of factor analysis, data manipulation, and visualization. You will learn to:

- Handle factor variables in R
- Perform statistical analysis on categorical data
- Create visualizations to represent patterns and relationships

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/petersonchiquetto/R_Factor.git
   cd R_Factor
   ```

2. Install the necessary R packages (if not already installed):

   ```r
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
   ```

3. Load the required libraries in your R session:

   ```r
   library(ggplot2)
   library(dplyr)
   library(tidyr)
   ```

4. Run the analysis and visualization scripts:

   ```r
   source("scripts/analysis.R")
   source("scripts/visualization.R")
   ```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

The `analysis.R` script provides a step-by-step process to:

- Load and clean categorical data
- Perform statistical analysis such as frequency counts and contingency tables
- Conduct tests like chi-squared tests to examine relationships between categorical variables

The `visualization.R` script helps you generate visual representations, including bar charts, pie charts, and other plots to easily interpret your findings.

---

## 🎨 Example Visualizations

Here’s a quick example of what you can generate with the project:

```r
# Example of creating a bar plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = factor_variable)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Bar Plot of Factor Variable")
```

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By working through this project, you will:

- Understand how to manipulate and analyze categorical data using R
- Learn to visualize factor variables and explore their relationships
- Gain insights into using R for data exploration and statistical analysis
